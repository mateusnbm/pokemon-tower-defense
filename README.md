# Pokemon Tower Defense Champions

A Pokemon inspired tower defense game wrote in C using the Allegro library.

This game was created by me and Renato ([@rvlb-19](https://github.com/rvlb-19)) as the final project for the Introduction to Programming class we took together in 2013 at the Federal University of Pernambuco. It was wrote in C using the [Allegro Library](http://liballeg.org).

All images and songs used in this game were created by us or found on the internet, as a publicly available resource. The resources were used only for educational purposes and no one ever obtained profit through them. If you own and do not authorize the usage of an image or song used in this game, contact us immediately for removal.

We've decided to make this software publicly available to serve as a guidance for people getting started with game development in C using the Allegro Library.
